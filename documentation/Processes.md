# Processes for Employees & Contractors

## Confidentiality
Unless otherwise noted, all source code is confidential, intellectual property and covered under the terms of your NDA.

## Software / Product Development

### Soure Code Change Management
As a software/product developer, you will be granted access to the appropriate project repositories on github - you must set up and identify your github account which is to be used for this purpose. You are responsible for ensuring that you are familiar with proper git and github usage.

All your contributions must be delivered via Pull Request such that your working branch will be merged with the primary development branch. You will need to create your feature branch off of the primary development branch when your assigned project commences and it will be merged back in when completed. You are responsible for ensuring that your feature branch is up-to-date (via rebase or periodic merges, or however you prefer). You should always `git pull` prior to `git push` just as a rule of thumb unless you have a specific, technical reason not to.
